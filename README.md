# Coding Challenges - Intro

Welcome to the Coding Challenges! 


These are challenges that I’ve used or am using as exercises to learn a new programming language or technology.

Each challenge will have you writing a full application or tool. Most of which will be based on real-world tools and utilities.

The challenges are picked to be small enough to be completed in your spare time over a week or two and yet large enough to be complete working projects.
